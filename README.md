# OpenFeeder
OpenSource feeder for DIY and OpenPNP community!

**Simple laser cut acrylic body, with 99% off the shelf hardware.** 

This feeder design is for MY machine. Extensive modifications to existing machines may be necessary to accommodate it. Its ment to fit a 20mm aluminum t-slot. I am useing t-slots from MakerSlide. 

Feel free to edit the source file. You must post edited files for all the use.

OpenFeeder was made with SketchUp 2013. Each part is on its own labeled layer.

# OVERVIEW:

Basic Operation: 
* tapeAdvanceArm is pressed down, tape is advanced. The more the arm is pressed, the more the tape is advanced (vise versa).
* Tape plastic cover is pulled backward with a small fishing weight.


Advanced Operation: 
* Both the tapeGuide and the exitGuide are adjustable for paper tapes heights and embossed tapes heights. See examples in photos folder.
* Wider tapes can be used by changing the tapeGuide width and the 8mm brass standoff height.
* As tapeAdvanceArm is pressed, the one way bearing is locked in rotation, thus turning the tapeSprocket. Once the tapeAdvanceArm is released, the one way bearing un-locks and allows the arm to return to the ready position.
