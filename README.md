# OpenFeeder
OpenSource feeder for DIY and OpenPNP community!



This feeder design is for MY machine. Extensive modifications to existing machines may be necessary to accommodate it. Its ment to fit a 20mm aluminum t-slot. I am useing t-slots from MakerSlide. 

Feel free to edit the source file. You must post edited files for all the use.



# OVERVIEW:
Basic Operation: 
* tapeAdvanceArm is pressed down, tape is advanced. The more the arm is pressed, the more the tape is advanced (vise versa).
* Tape plastic cover is pulled backward with a small fishing weight.


Advanced Operation: 
* Both the tapeGuide and the exitGuide are adjustable for paper tapes heights and embossed tapes heights. See examples in photos folder.
* Wider tapes can be used by changing the tapeGuide width and the 8mm brass standoff height.
* As tapeAdvanceArm is pressed, the one way bearing is locked in rotation, thus turning the tapeSprocket. Once the tapeAdvanceArm is released, the one way bearing un-locks and allows the arm to return to the ready position.
